# Rule Handling Approaches: Performance and Scalability Benchmark

This table benchmarks various rule-handling approaches based on scalability, performance, and maintainability for a growing number of rules.

| **Approach**     | **Scalability** | **Performance** | **Maintainability** |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Enum**         | ★☆☆☆☆            | ★★★★☆           | ★★☆☆☆               |
| **Factory**      | ★★★☆☆            | ★★★★☆           | ★★★☆☆               |
| **Strategy**     | ★★★☆☆            | ★★★☆☆           | ★★★★☆               |
| **Stream API**   | ★★★★☆            | ★★★☆☆           | ★★★★☆               |
| **Switch Case**  | ★★☆☆☆            | ★★★☆☆           | ★★☆☆☆               |
| **If-Else**      | ★★☆☆☆            | ★★★☆☆           | ★★☆☆☆               |
| **Rule Engine**  | ★★★★★            | ★★☆☆☆           | ★★★★★               |

## Summary of Performance Benchmark Based on Number of Rules

- **Small Rule Sets**: Enum, Factory Pattern, Strategy Pattern, or Switch Case.
- **Medium Rule Sets**: Factory Pattern, Strategy Pattern, or Stream API.
- **Large Rule Sets**: Rule Engine, Stream API.

### Choosing Based on Scale:
- **Fewer Rules** (up to ~10-20): Go for simpler approaches like **Enum**, **Factory**, or **Strategy Patterns**.
- **Medium-sized Rule Sets**: The **Stream API** offers good flexibility and readability.
- **Large, Dynamic Rule Sets**: A **Rule Engine** (like Drools or Easy Rules) is the best option due to its scalability and maintainability, despite the slight performance overhead.
